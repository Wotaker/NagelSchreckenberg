# NagelSchreckenberg
Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic flow model, with overtaking extension.
Created by Marcin Kroczek and me.

Our model is an extension of classic Nagel-Schreckenberg CAmodel, that imposes cars no changing their lanes.
Multi-lane model however, allows cars to change lanes and conduct overtake manoeuvres. Motivation for creating 
our model was to examine how the ability of overtaking changes traffic flow in comparison to the single-lane Nagel-Schreckenberg model.

Further reading you may find in the Multilane_NaSch_final.pdf file, where we explain the rules behind overtaking and discuss the results
